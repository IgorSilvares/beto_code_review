"""
Given a hierarchical structure of offices/locations where users from a location can access data from locations below it but is restricted from accessing data from locations above it,
 write scenarios on how you are going to assert the hierarchical relationships between the locations. Suppose you have a test data in location B:

      A
      |
----------------
|               |
B               C
                |
         ---------------
        |               |
        D               E
